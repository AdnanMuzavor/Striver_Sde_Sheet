# Striver_Sde_Sheet
Striver SDE sheet is helpful sheet for approaching to a valid solution to a problem.

## Day 1
- Approaches:  Sliding window
- Algorithms: Kadane Algorithm, Next permutation algorithm 

## Day 2
- Approaches: Negative indexing values of array to find repeating and missing
- Algorithms: Merge sort and it's use to count inversions
- Special   : Finding duplicate using linkedlist appraoch given array of [1,n] elements.

## Day 3
- Approaches : Apply merge sort to find count of next smaller elements, count reverse pairs etc.
- Algorithms : Voting Moore Algorithm to find majority element.

## Day 4
### Approaches  
- reducing 4 sum from  O(N^4) to O(N^3logN) to O(N^2logN) by sorting, 
- using map to find unique pair making up given sum.
- largest subarray with sum 0 using map and concept of repeating sum
- largest consecutive sequence in array using Sorting and Map approach.
- learnt xor technique to find count(sub-arrays) with given xor.


## Day 5
- Approaches : slow-fast pointer approach to find middle, delete last nth node
- Algorithm : recursive merge sort to merge to sorted linkedlist.

## Day 6
### Approaches: 
- tracking cycle,find node cycled using slow/fast pointer.
- flattening the linkedlist using merge sort and recursion.
- intersection of two LL using equi distancing.
- checking palindrome using vector, manipulating LL.
- reversing nodes in k groups using proper pointer linking.

## Day 7
### Approaches: copy LL with random pointer [map + LL manip approach].
- rotate LL simply by pointer manip and k%len logic.
- use pointers to find max consecutive ones and removing duplicates.
- trapping rain water by keeping track of tallest walls around and selecting min among them.
