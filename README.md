# Striver_Sde_Sheet
Striver SDE sheet is helpful sheet for approaching to a valid solution to a problem.

## Day 1
- Approaches:  Sliding window
- Algorithms: Kadane Algorithm, Next permutation algorithm 

## Day 2
- Approaches: Negative indexing values of array to find repeating and missing
- Algorithms: Merge sort and it's use to count inversions
- Special   : Finding duplicate using linkedlist appraoch given array of [1,n] elements.

## Day 3
- Approaches : Apply merge sort to find count of next smaller elements, count reverse pairs etc.
- Algorithms : Voting Moore Algorithm to find majority element.

## Day 4
### Approaches  
- reducing 4 sum from  O(N^4) to O(N^3logN) to O(N^2logN) by sorting, 
- using map to find unique pair making up given sum.
- largest subarray with sum 0 using map and concept of repeating sum
- largest consecutive sequence in array using Sorting and Map approach.
- learnt xor technique to find count(sub-arrays) with given xor.
